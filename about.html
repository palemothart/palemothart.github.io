        <p>Welcome to Pale Moth Art!  We are still under construction.</p>
        <h2>About the Artist</h2>
        <p>Angel lives on the Oregon Coast with her husband and six dogs (yes, six).  She enjoys working with a variety of media including acrylic paint, wood, papier mache, and her first love, colored pencils.</p>
        <h2>About the Gothlings</h2>
        <p>Gothlings are like faeries, but darker.  They live in dark, warm places like your grandmother's cluttered attic and only come out at night.  If you are ever lucky enough to see one, it will probably be on Halloween night (Samhain) when the veil between the worlds is thin and the temptation of sugary treats is hard to resist.</p>
        <p>Angel's Gothlings are made of hand-carved wood painted with acrylics, and their wings are made of painted canvas paper.  If you're lucky enough to catch one, they make great traveling companions in the car.  No two are alike...</p>
